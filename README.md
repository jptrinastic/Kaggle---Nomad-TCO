# Kaggle--Nomad-TCO

This project provides a Jupyter notebook covering analyses used for the Nomad-TCO Kaggle competition.  The goal of the competition was to predict the band gap and formation energies of transparent conducting oxides using nothing except geometric information about various supercell lattices including various amounts of indium, gallium, aluminum, and oxygen.

The stacked ensemble model described in the notebook performed in the top 6% of all competitors.  The simpler support vector machines included earlier in the notebook actually performed better, matching the top 3% of competitors, however I did not choose these for my final submission.  The competition was an interesting case of preventing overfitting in the validation sets and using overly complex models to describe patterns in band gap and formation energy.
